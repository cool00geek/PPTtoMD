# PPTtoMD
Convert PowerPoints (PPTX) to Github flavored Markdown

This is just a quick-n-dirty program to get the job done. It takes a pptx (from a prompt) and outputs the presentation in markdown format.
This does NOT follow proper formatting for links and images, and may very well crash the program.
